## Overview <a name="overview"></a>

Apla Blockchain is a platform which was developed for building digital ecosystems. The platform includes an integrated application development environment with a multi-level system of access rights to data, interfaces and smart contracts.

Apla Blockchain Platform consists of two main components:
- Backend

  Contains:
  - Centrifugo notification service
  - Go-Apla kernel service (includes Apla TCP and API servers)
  - PostgreSQL database
  
- Frontend
  
  Consist of Molis client that can be builded as native OS application or web-application
  
In production environment, each of these components (backend and frontend) can be deployed on different hosts and OS.

In this guide we will deployed Apla Blockchain Platform based on three nodes on the test ICT-infrastructure and build Molis client. As Apla node OS we will used:
 - Debian 9 (Stretch) 64-bit [official distributive](https://www.debian.org/CD/http-ftp/#stable) with installed GNOME GUI 
 - Windows Server 2012R2/2016

For test purposes, all of these hosts are connected to each other in simple network and have IP-addresses: 10.10.99.1-10.10.99.3
